         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OUR Majeſties moſt Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Subjects, the Lords and Commons, cannot conceive that the <hi>Declaration</hi> which your Majeſty received from Us at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> was ſuch as did deſerve that Cenſure your Majeſty was pleaſed to lay upon Us, in that Speech which your Majeſty made to Our Committees there, and ſent in writing to both Houſes: Our Adreſſes therein being accompanied
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156548:3"/>with Plainneſſe, Humility and Faithfullnes, We thought more proper for the removing the Diſtraction of the Kingdome, then if We had then proceeded according to your Majeſties Meſſage of the 20. of <hi>January,</hi> by which your Majeſty was pleaſed to deſire that we would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what we intended to doe for your Majeſty, and what We expected to be done for Our Selves; in both which, We have bin very much hindred by your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Deniall to ſecure Us and the whole Kingdome, by diſpoſing the <hi>Militia,</hi> as We had divers times moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Petitioned; and We have not bin altogether neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent of either, having lately made good proceedings, in preparing a Book of Rates to be paſſed in a Bill of Tunnage and Poundage, and likewiſe the moſt Materiall Heads of thoſe Humble deſires which We intended to Make to your Majeſty, for the good and contentment of your Majeſtie, and your People: But now, if theſe could not bee perfected till the Kingdome bee put into Safety, by ſettling the <hi>Militia;</hi> and untill your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhalbe pleaſed to Concurre with your Parliament in thoſe neceſſary things, We hold it impoſſible for you to give the world, or your People ſuch ſatisfaction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Feares and Jealouſies which We have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, as We hope your Majeſty hath already received, touching that Exception which you were pleaſed to take to Mr. PYMS Speech.</p>
            <p>As for your own Feares and Doubts, the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being from Seditious Pamphlets and Sermons, We ſhall as carefully indeavour to remove it, aſſoone as: We underſtand what Pamphlets are by your Majeſty inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as we have bin to prevent all dangerous Tumults. And if any Extraordinary Concourſe of People out of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156548:3"/>the City to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> had the face and ſhew of Tumult and Danger, in your Majeſties, apprehenſions, it will appeare to be cauſed by your Majeſties Deniall of ſuch a Guard to your Parliament, as they might have cauſe to Confide in; And by taking in <hi>White-Hall</hi> ſuch a Guard for your ſelfe, as gave juſt Cauſe of Jealouſie to the Parliament, and of Terrour and offence to your People. We ſeeke nothing but your Majeſties peace, and the proſperity of your Kindomes; and Wee are heartily ſorrie We have ſuch plentifull Matter of an Anſwere to that Queſtion, <hi>Whether you have viclated Our Laws?</hi> We beſeech your Majeſty to remember, that the Government of this Kingdome, as it was in great part managed by your Miniſters, before the beginning of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> conſiſted of many continued and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed Acts of violation of Laws, the wounds whereof were ſcarcely healed, when the Extremity of all their violations was farre exceeded by this late, ſtrange, and unheard of breach of our Laws in the accuſation of the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> and the five Members of the <hi>Commons Houſe,</hi> and proceedings thereupon, for which we have yet received no full ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>To your Majeſties next Queſtion, Whether you had denied any Bill for the caſe and ſecurity of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? We wiſh we could ſtoppe in the midſt of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That with much, thankfulneſſe we acknowledge that your Majeſty hath paſſed many good Bills, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll of contentment and advantage to your People, but truth and neceſſity inforceth us to adde this, That even in or about the time of paſſing thoſe Bills ſome: deſigne or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath bin a foote, which if it had taken effect would not only have deprived us of the fruit of thoſe Bills, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156548:4"/>have reduced us to a worſe condition of confuſion then that, wherein the <hi>Parliament</hi> found us.</p>
            <p>And if your Majeſty had asked us the third Queſtion Intimated in that Speech, <hi>What Wee had done for your Selfe?</hi> Our Anſwere would have bin much more eaſie; That Wee have paid two Armies, wherewith the Kingdome was burdened laſt yeare. That we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken a Warre with <hi>Ireland:</hi> all which great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and the Charges thereupon have bin occaſioned by the evill Councells, ſo powerfull with your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, which have and will coſt this Kingdome more then two Millions, all which in Juſtice ought to have bin borne by your Majeſty.</p>
            <p>As for the free and generall pardon, your Majeſtie hath bin pleaſed to offer, it can be no ſecurity to our Feares and Jealouſies, for which your Majeſty ſeems to propound it, becauſe they ariſe not from any Guilt of our owne Actions, but from the evill deſignes and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of others.</p>
            <p>To this our humble Anſwer to that Speech we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to adde an information which we lately received from the Deputy Governour of the <hi>Marchant Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> That an unknowne Perſon appertaining to the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> did lately ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156548:4"/>Circumſtances, it is accompanied of the Lord <hi>Digbyes</hi> preceding expreſſions, in a Letter to her Majeſty, and Sir <hi>Lewis Diues;</hi> and your Majeſties ſucceeding courſe of withdwrawing your ſelfe North-ward from your Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, in a manner very ſutable and correſpondent with that evill Counſell, which we doubt will make much deeper impreſſion in the generality of your people: and therefore we moſt humbly deſire, for the procuring and ſetling our and their confidence, and the other Reaſons concerning the recovery of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſecuring this Kingdome, which have beene formerly preſented to your Majeſtie, you will be graciouſly pleaſed, with all convenient ſpeed to returne to theſe parts, and to cloſe with the adviſe and deſire of your <hi>Parliament:</hi> Where you ſhall find their dutifull affections and endeavours, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to attend your Majeſtie, with ſuch entertainment as ſhall not onely give your Majeſtie juſt cauſe of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in their faithfulneſſe, but other manifeſt evidences of their earneſt deſires, to advance your Majeſties ſervice, Honour and contentment, and to eſtabliſh it upon the ſure foundation of the Peace and Proſperity of all your <hi>Kingdomes.</hi>
